Lets take a look at what our Tableau analysis of the CitiBike dataset showed us.

First of all, our dataset consists of 12 csv files containing the CitiBike data for each month of 2020. That was then put together (union) to look at the entire year in our analysis.

Stations:
Our station page shows all the bike stations, one graph for journey starting locations and one for journey ending locations. Popularity of stations is shown by both color and size. A couple of callouts here are that the most popular starting and ending stations are fairly consistent, but it seems like something happened where there were no trips started in NYC proper during 2020. Best guess is Covid related shutdowns, but more inspection on other compounding factors would need to be done.

Rider Breakdown
Our next story page shows what our riders looked like in the year 2020. We can take a look at what gender our users are, their age category, and the type of user (weather they were a short pass user or a long term annual member). Some observations/ questions we wanted to answer here are:
- Our riders ages are not heavily biased towards a certain age group. Of course there are some age groups that have more riders than others but there are not huge extremes that might have been expected, like 80% of riders being under 30 or something similar. Instead we have a fairly high count of users in most categories, really showing that our bikes are helpful for all ages. 
- Another callout is looking at our Usertype breakdown. We show to have a great breakdown of user types, the higher and preferable option being a long term annual subscriber. We can see in the User breakdown though that we could create advertising and incentives to bring on more female subscribers.

Rider Historical Dashboard
Finally lets take a look at the historical data of 2020.
Interestingly enough we had an increase in riders during 2020 that has seemed to even out back to beginning of the year counts. Seems like we could do more to keep our username climbing.
As expected though there is a sharp dip in users at the beginning of pandemic/lockdown (March/April) that then was countered by a spike during the Sept/Oct. So although we had some volatility it could be that the positive here is that we ended the year with similar numbers as the beginning indicating we did not have a net decline of users. 
Beyond that trends among gender and user types are tracking along fairly the same. No gender or user type decided to increase or decrease usage outside of the average. 
Historical age average has remained consistent, interesting during Covid.
